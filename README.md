**AutoGallery** is a Pinterest-esque self-contained and static photo gallery that is automagically generated from a shell script and viewed in any browser.

# Development
I intend to rewrite it in Python as a fully featured static web photo gallery.

**Features**
- Metadata in YAML file
- Timeline scrolling
- Tag searching
- Authentication
- PWA

**Minor**
- Browsing with keyboard arrows
- Outline when hovering cards

TODO: Publish on GitLab. +done

TODO: Setup script with hook to autofetch library files from lightgallery.js git repo. +done
