**AutoGallery** is a Pinterest-esque static photo gallery that is automagically generated from a shell script and viewed in any browser.

# Development
I intend to rewrite it in Python as a fully featured static web photo gallery.

**Features**
- Metadata in YAML file
- Timeline scrolling
- Tag searching
- Authentication
- PWA

TODO: Make script and git hook to update lightagallery library.
TODO: Upload to GitLab.
